# ✦ SYSTEM OVERVIEW

A monochrome, high-fidelity interface designed as a **classified engineering console**.
This portfolio compiles my work across AI, robotics, and intelligent system design into a single operational dashboard.

The UI is constructed with precision:

* crisp edges
* soft gradients
* terminal-inspired alignment
* high-tech minimize/maximize behaviors
* and a fully interactive AI chatbot module (JARVIS v2.0)

No noise.
No decoration.
Just engineering.
