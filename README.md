# ✦ SYSTEM OVERVIEW  
A monochrome, high-fidelity interface designed as a **classified engineering console**.  
This portfolio compiles my work across AI, robotics, and intelligent system design into a single operational dashboard.

Built with precision:  
• crisp, minimal UI geometry  
• soft technical gradients  
• terminal-inspired interactions  
• AI-powered conversational module  

Pure engineering. Zero noise.
